## The project life cycle

### Initiate the project

In this phase, ask questions to help set the foundation for the project, such as:

* Who are the stakeholders?
* What are the client’s or customer’s goals?
* What is the purpose and mission of the project?
* What are the measurable objectives for the team?  
* What is the project trying to improve?     
* When does this project need to be completed?   
* What skills and resources will the project require? 
* What will the project cost? What are the benefits?

### Make a plan

In this phase, make a plan to get your project from start to finish.

Create a detailed project plan. What are the major milestones? What tasks or deliverables make up each milestone?  
Build out the schedule so you can properly manage the resources, budget, materials, and timeline. Here, you will create an itemized budget.

### Execute the project

In this phase, put all of your hard work from the first two phases into action.

* Monitor your project team as they complete project tasks. 
* Break down any barriers that would slow or stop the team from completing tasks. 
* Help keep the team aware of schedule and deliverable expectations.
* Address weaknesses in your process or examine places where your team may need additional training to meet the project’s goals.
* Adapt to changes in the project as they arise.

### Close the project

In this phase, close out the project.

* Identify that your team has completed all of the requested outcomes.   
* Release your team so they can support other projects within the company.  
* Take time with your team to celebrate your successes!   
* Pass off all remaining deliverables and get stakeholder approval.  
* Document the lessons you and your team learned during the project.  
* Reflect on ways to improve in the future.


## Project management approaches

**Waterfall** is a traditional methodology in which tasks and phases are completed in a linear, sequential manner, and each stage of the project must be completed before the next begins. The project manager is responsible for prioritizing and assigning tasks to team members. In Waterfall, the criteria used to measure quality is clearly defined at the beginning of the project.

**Agile** involves short phases of collaborative, iterative work with frequent testing and regularly-implemented improvements. Some phases and tasks happen at the same time as others. In Agile projects, teams share responsibility for managing their own work. Scrum and Kanban are examples of Agile frameworks, which are specific development approaches based on the Agile philosophy.

**Scrum** is an Agile framework that focuses on developing, delivering, and sustaining complex projects and products through collaboration, accountability, and an iterative process. Work is completed by small, cross-functional teams led by a Scrum Master and is divided into short Sprints with a set list of deliverables.

**Kanban** is both an Agile approach and a tool that provides visual feedback about the status of the work in progress through the use of Kanban boards or charts. With Kanban, project managers use sticky notes or note cards on a physical or digital Kanban board to represent the team’s tasks with categories like “To do,” “In progress,” and “Done.”

**Lean** uses the 5S quality tool to eliminate eight areas of waste, save money, improve quality, and streamline processes. The main principle in Lean methodology is the removal of waste within an operation. By optimizing process steps and eliminating waste, only value is added at each phase of production. Lean uses a Kanban scheduling system to manage production. Implement Lean project management when you want to use limited resources, reduce waste, and streamline processes to gain maximum benefits.

  **5S helps you boost performance.**
  1. Sort: Remove all items not needed for current production operations and leave only the bare essentials. 
  2. Set in order: Arrange needed items so that they are easy to use. Label items so that anyone can find them or put them away. 
  3. Shine: Keep everything in the correct place. Clean your workspace every day.
  4. Standardize: Perform the process in the same way every time. 
  5. Sustain: Make a habit of maintaining correct procedures and instill this discipline in your team.

**Six Sigma** involves reducing variations by ensuring that quality processes are followed every time. The Six Sigma method follows a process-improvement approach called DMAIC, which stands for define, measure, analyze, improve, and control. The term “Six Sigma” originates from statistics and generally means that items or processes should have 99.9996% quality.

  <summary> > Seven key principles of Six Sigma</summary>
  
  1. Always focus on the customer.
  2. Identify and understand how the work gets done. Understand how work really happens.
  3. Make your processes flow smoothly.
  4. Reduce waste and concentrate on value.
  5. Stop defects by removing variation.
  6. Involve and collaborate with your team.
  7. Approach improvement activity in a systematic way.
  
  The largest difference between Lean and Six Sigma is that Lean streamlines processes while Six Sigma reduces variation in products by building in quality from the beginning and inspecting products to ensure quality standards are met.

**Lean Six Sigma** is a combination of Lean and Six Sigma approaches. It is often used in projects that aim to save money, improve quality, and move through processes quickly. Lean Six Sigma is also ideal for solving complex or high-risk problems. The 5S quality tool, the DMAIC process, and the use of Kanban boards are all components of this approach.
