## The project life cycle

### Initiate the project

In this phase, ask questions to help set the foundation for the project, such as:

* Who are the stakeholders?
* What are the client’s or customer’s goals?
* What is the purpose and mission of the project?
* What are the measurable objectives for the team?  
* What is the project trying to improve?     
* When does this project need to be completed?   
* What skills and resources will the project require? 
* What will the project cost? What are the benefits?

### Make a plan

In this phase, make a plan to get your project from start to finish.

Create a detailed project plan. What are the major milestones? What tasks or deliverables make up each milestone?  
Build out the schedule so you can properly manage the resources, budget, materials, and timeline. Here, you will create an itemized budget.

### Execute the project

In this phase, put all of your hard work from the first two phases into action.

* Monitor your project team as they complete project tasks. 
* Break down any barriers that would slow or stop the team from completing tasks. 
* Help keep the team aware of schedule and deliverable expectations.
* Address weaknesses in your process or examine places where your team may need additional training to meet the project’s goals.
* Adapt to changes in the project as they arise.

### Close the project

In this phase, close out the project.

* Identify that your team has completed all of the requested outcomes.   
* Release your team so they can support other projects within the company.  
* Take time with your team to celebrate your successes!   
* Pass off all remaining deliverables and get stakeholder approval.  
* Document the lessons you and your team learned during the project.  
* Reflect on ways to improve in the future.


## Lean and Six Sigma methodologies

**Lean.** The main principle in Lean methodology is the removal of waste within an operation. By optimizing process steps and eliminating waste, only value is added at each phase of production. Implement Lean project management when you want to use limited resources, reduce waste, and streamline processes to gain maximum benefits.

**5S helps you boost performance.**
1. Sort: Remove all items not needed for current production operations and leave only the bare essentials. 
2. Set in order: Arrange needed items so that they are easy to use. Label items so that anyone can find them or put them away. 
3. Shine: Keep everything in the correct place. Clean your workspace every day.
4. Standardize: Perform the process in the same way every time. 
5. Sustain: Make a habit of maintaining correct procedures and instill this discipline in your team.

The final concept of Lean uses a **Kanban** scheduling system to manage production. **Kanban** board is a visualization tool that gives the team a visual display to identify what needs to be done and when.

  <summary>Six Sigma - soft-skill bullshit</summary>
  
  `Six Sigma` is a methodology used to reduce variations by ensuring that quality processes are followed every time. The term “Six Sigma” originates from statistics and generally means that items or processes should have 99.9996% quality.
  
  The seven key principles of Six Sigma are:
  1. Always focus on the customer.
  2. Identify and understand how the work gets done. Understand how work really happens.
  3. Make your processes flow smoothly.
  4. Reduce waste and concentrate on value.
  5. Stop defects by removing variation.
  6. Involve and collaborate with your team.
  7. Approach improvement activity in a systematic way.
  
  The largest difference between these methodologies is that Lean streamlines processes while Six Sigma reduces variation in products by building in quality from the beginning and inspecting products to ensure quality standards are met.
